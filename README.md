# Notes

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and uses the following packages:

 - Styled components for component styling
 - Apollo client and graphql for api queries
 - Dompurify to sanitize html provided by api before rendering to screen
 - React router for navigation

## Concessions and improvements

 - If I spend more time on the app, I would firstly add pagination to the results to allow the user to view the next 10 or more results if they desire
 - I would add unit tests using jest and react testing library
 - I would add integration tests to test the user flow through the app
 - I would improve the typing and styling across the app
 - I would eventually add booking possibilities to the app

## Available Scripts

To start the app, change to the project directory within the terminal and then run:
##### `npm start`

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `npm test`

There are currently no tests on this app, but running this script launches the test runner.
